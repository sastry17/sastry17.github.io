<h1>Shreyas Srinivasa</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify">Hi! I am a Ph.D. Fellow at the Cybersecurity Research Group at Aalborg University, Denmark. My topics of interest include Cyber Deception, Threat Intelligence, and Internet Security Measurements.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I work primarily with honeypots to gather the threat landscape and understand attacker behavior. Other than honeypots, I scan the Internet to find gaps in the deployment and configuration of systems. I believe that most security incidents are caused either due to improper testing or misconfigured deployments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">If my work interests you or you would like to collaborate,&nbsp; please feel free to contact me!&nbsp;</p>
