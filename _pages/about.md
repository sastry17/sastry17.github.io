Hi! I am a Ph.D. Fellow at the [Cybersecurity Research Group](https://www.cyber.aau.dk/research/) at Aalborg University, Denmark. My topics of interest include Cyber Deception, Threat Intelligence, and Internet Security Measurements. 

I work primarily with honeypots to gather the threat landscape and understand attacker behavior. Other than honeypots, I periodically scan the Internet to find gaps in the deployment and configuration of systems. I believe that most security incidents are caused either due to improper testing or misconfigured deployments.  

If my work interests you or you would like to collaborate,  please feel free to contact me!
