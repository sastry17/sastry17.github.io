Hi! I am a Ph.D. Fellow at the [Cybersecurity Research Group](https://www.cyber.aau.dk/research/) at Aalborg University, Denmark. My topics of interest include Cyber Deception, Threat Intelligence, and Internet Security Measurements. I am supervised by [Dr. Jens Myrup Pedersen](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/107697) and [Dr. Emmanouil Vasilomanolakis](https://mvasiloma.com/). 

I work primarily with honeypots to gather the threat landscape and understand attacker behavior. Other than honeypots, I periodically scan the Internet to find gaps in the deployment and configuration of systems. I believe that most security incidents are caused either due to improper security testing or misconfigured deployments. My current interest revolves around Counter Cyber Deception techniques, where I try to find methods to detect deceptive cyber entities used as defensive strategies. 

I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Alice Hutchings](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ah793/) and [Dr. Richard Clayton](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/) as a [visiting researcher](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ss2896) at the [Cambridge Cybercrime Center](https://www.cambridgecybercrime.uk/) at the University of Cambridge between January - April 2022. 

I also try to contribute to [opensource-projects](https://sastry17.github.io/opensource/) (GSoC), mostly related to honeypots and system fingerprinting. If my work interests you or you would like to collaborate,  please feel free to contact me! 

My Ph.D. is funded by [COM<sup>3</sup>](https://northsearegion.eu/com-3/), an Interreg project supported by the North Sea Programme of the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union.
